# Angular-Basic
Starting from the basics of angular

Index Page:
- Add title of project using interpolation binding
- Using element selector to add HeroesComponent to AppComponent (index page)

Heroes Page:
- Using interface to store hero information by importing Hero.ts into component page
- Using interpolation binding to display hero information and pipes to make the name uppercase
- Two-way data binding for the input element and hero name so it updates as the input.value updates
- ngFor as a repeater to list all the host elements (heros in this case)
- Add event binding for clicking on an element on the list (using function onSelect)
- Class binding to change css properties for when a hero is selected

Notes:
- Version control between devices used caused a major issue when working on this project with vulnerabilities and errors
